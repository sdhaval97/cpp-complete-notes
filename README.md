# My C++ Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal repository for learning C++ from scratch. This project documents my entire journey, starting from the absolute basics of the language and progressing towards advanced data structures and algorithms.

This repository serves as my personal notebook, a space for experimentation, and a portfolio of my growth as a C++ developer. The goal is to build a strong foundation in C++ and computer science fundamentals through a structured, project-based approach.

## The Learning Roadmap

This journey is divided into three core phases. Each phase builds upon the knowledge of the previous one.

### Phase 1: C++ Fundamentals
This phase focuses on the core syntax, features, and building blocks of the C++ language. The goal is to get comfortable writing, compiling, and running basic console applications.

**Topics Covered:**
- Basic Syntax, Variables, and Data Types  
- Input/Output (I/O) Streams  
- Control Flow (If-Else, Loops)  
- Functions  
- Arrays, `std::string`, and `std::vector`  
- Pointers and Memory Management  
- Structs and File I/O  

---

### Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This phase introduces the object-oriented paradigm, a crucial concept for building scalable and maintainable software.

**Topics Covered:**
- Classes and Objects  
- Encapsulation (Public, Private)  
- Constructors and Destructors  
- The `this` Pointer  
- Splitting code into Header (`.hpp`) and Source (`.cpp`) files  

---

### Phase 3: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
With a solid grasp of the language, this phase dives into fundamental computer science concepts. Each data structure will be implemented from scratch to gain a deep understanding of its inner workings.

**Topics Covered:**
- Analysis of Time and Space Complexity ($O(n)$)  
- **Data Structures:** Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables, Graphs, etc.  
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversal, etc.  

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to the learning phases.

```
CPP-Learning-Journey/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Phase-1_CPP-Fundamentals/
â”œâ”€â”€ Phase-2_Object-Oriented-Programming/
â””â”€â”€ Phase-3_Data-Structures-Algorithms/
```

Each folder will contain small projects and code examples relevant to its topic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To compile and run the code in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler:

- **GCC (g++):** Commonly used on Linux and available on Windows (via MinGW or WSL).  
- **Clang:** Commonly used on macOS.  
- **MSVC:** Provided with Visual Studio on Windows.  

### Building & Running the Code
Most of the initial projects are single-file programs and can be compiled with a simple command from your terminal.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory where the .cpp file is located
cd Phase-1_CPP-Fundamentals/01_Basics_IO_Variables/

# Compile the C++ file (-o specifies the output executable name)
g++ your_file_name.cpp -o output_executable

# Run the compiled program
./output_executable
```

> **Note:** As the projects become more complex, this repository may adopt a build system like **CMake** for easier management.

## My Learning Philosophy

- **Build to Learn:** Focus on hands-on, practical projects rather than just theory.  
- **Master the Fundamentals:** Ensure a solid understanding of the basics before moving to more complex topics.  
- **Document the Process:** This README and the code comments will serve as documentation of my learning process.  
- **Consistency is Key:** Progress is made by writing code consistently, even if it's just a little bit each day.
